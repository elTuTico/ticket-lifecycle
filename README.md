For this portion of the excercise navigation and utilization of the evnviornment that was created on the osTicket database will be implemnented to through Users and Admins. Using the “End User” login URL (http://localhost/osTicket/ )  a handful of spoof tickets with varying severity will be created, have them looked over by varying departments/agents, and lastly solved to allow the end user to return to whatever tasks they had prior to their technical issues. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Click “Open a New Ticket”. Fill in the information for “Email Address” and “Full Name” with the information created in the previous section of this practical. Select one of the help topics created from the previous section of this practical. Lastly, create a little description of what this specific issue is for this end user. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now utilzing one of the previously created Agents this ticket will be resolved by loging in and examining the information submitted by the end user.
</p>

</p>
<p>
As an agent there should be a view of all of the tickets that have rolled in for the Department. From there the Agent should be able to select one of the tickets and inquire a bit more information on the ticket submitted by the end user. Which might prompt the Agent to change the qualities of the ticket itself to properly quantify its impact. 
</p>

<p>
For this example an issue affecting the customers access to the banking application is pretty severe. Go about adjusting the department over to “System Administrator” and the priority to “Emergency”. All of these changes could be found on the thread at the bottom of the ticket itself that outlines the work that has been put into solving the issue at hand. This is also a great place to jot down notes, queries, and information from department/agent to department/agent. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Log out as the agent and log back in as the system administrator to start working on the ticket. Upon logging into the system administrator account there should be a brief breakdown of the ticket that has been passed over to the department. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Play around with the thread attached to this ticket and create a bit of a trail as to the kind of attempts that are being made towards fixing the issue at hand. Once enough of a paper trail has occurred go ahead and close out the ticket while labeling the kind of solution that was done to resolve the ticket. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Continue to play around with the environment created by making more tickets with the end users. Having the System Admin assign them to other agents/departments, and create a bit of a recurring log showing the kind of work was thrown at solving the tickets. Until then the System Admin and Agents should have a clean ticket dashboard, just waiting for the next ticket to come their way.
